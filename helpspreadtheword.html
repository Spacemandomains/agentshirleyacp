			<p>The @FCC launched a new program on December 31, 2021: Low-income households can now apply for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which includes monthly internet discounts, an Enhanced Tribal Benefit, and a one-time device discount. To learn more, go to AffordableConnectivity.gov. (Twitter)</p>
			<p>USAC has created a toolkit that includes resources organizations can use to make consumers aware of the new Affordable Connectivity Program and give them the opportunity to participate.</p>
			<p>Consumer advocacy groups, social service agencies, and other organizations that support eligible households are welcome to print and distribute any or all of the toolkitâ€™s resources in their communities. Additionally, all are welcome to integrate the web banners and tiles into their websites.</p>
			<p>Flyer and Brochure</p>
			<p>Social Media</p>
			<p>We encourage translation of these resources to share beyond English-speaking communities.</p>
			<p>The primary goal of consumer outreach is to help consumers understand how to apply for the Affordable Connectivity Program. There are three ways to apply for the ACP: online, mail, or through a participating internet company.</p>
